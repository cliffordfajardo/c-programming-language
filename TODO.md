Use godbolt shareable url examples.
Perhaps show people how to use it or link to a youtube video?



How can I make this a guided struggle journey?
I don't want them to just copy and paste my code. Maybe I can ask them to recreate it by, getting use to the environment

How can I make this less passive?


Marketing on github repo
- also market the syscalls repo.



I think asking the user questions while they're learning is important.




Mental barriers when learning a new programming language
- Don't think too much about how it's done in your language for too long. Embrace this new language for what it is; the future one's will be easier with this mindset




I should make modules on printing etc.
Go over the duke course.....





How can I help learners develop a hacker mindset?
I also want to show them where there tools live....notice all these files...these come from the C standard library that came on your computer.



Give viewers assurance this will be a good investment, you've probably seen tons of books on Amazon, should I buy k&r, this or that...
Practical approach


Tips...
using man 2 and 3 for every exercise.
Leave them a set of questions

What justifies my expectation

Come up with 3-4 questions



When an error occurs: *What justifies my expectation that ___*






If I do make videos, how can i bring meaning and historical context?



I think having a comprehensive set of code and test your knowledge section's will help a lot.
Kind of like K&R? Implement the cat program.


If your coming from a high level language, you'll learn how your language works under the hood.
If your coming from another language like Rust, you'll learn how C influenced other languages


Learn how to implement an event loop? Or is that out of scope? Might be good suggestion...if it took mark 2 days, imagine this.




Add intermediate challenges. Going back and creating header files....at this point I think every section should be self-contained then `004-../program{1,2,3}`








I want students to hit a pitfall. Ex: line terminating strings. But they can at least use the glossary i've built


https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/210606/is-there-an-advantage-for-a-c-programmer-to-have-read-kr


My value
- I understand as well that it''s not just about copying ans pasting, I've created a course where you'll struggle with guidance


## Philosophy



Somehow leverage Bradfield....prompts....book readings..





Ideas, students can keep this, update it , modify it as they continue to learn it's their journey...an interesting approacj...mention the book I'm writing



The benefit of doing it on your computer...real world evnironment... learn the compiler commands...if it's all in the cloud its too easy




TODO: after completing the course......go through the codecademy tutorial.

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus/modules/learn-cpp-functions


Vectorshttps://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus/modules/learn-cpp-vectors

Be clear about what I am abstracting
- I read these books, I wrote these books while learning the language and a few years of programming experience.
- I care about the learning process. Guided struggle...I became very godo by...

How can I keep this brief and compact? I can't cater to everyone. I think the best bet is to do this incrementally
while I'm learning about NodeJS.........perhaps tackle the NAPI?
- Write an event loop in C?
- It needs to be done differently.


Call outs. As always, if you get stuck consider
- reading the man pages, reasoning about it in pseudo code for a brief moment then googling.














Conclusion:

Where to go from here:

Books
- The Linux Programming Interface
- OSTEP
