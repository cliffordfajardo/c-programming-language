Work entirely offline
enough documentation to help you learn the language quick...man pages help
Ability to play around with the code, modify examples, make it real...what else..


I wrote these books while learning the languages, often learning 3-4 languages....so the mindset is different,



### Reality
1. You probably won't find many good resources out there written from this perspective.

2. You become a c master, but you'll be much better. This is
what happened to me. I took a computer architecture class to get more exposure of this new landscape (spent a few days on it)...

A year later, I came back to C, but again I struggled picking it up. I looked at my old code notes in my github repo and it wasn't to useful.

This book breaks out everything into small modules. Modules that are fully self-contained.

This is a book and repository that hopefully you'll come back
to, pick up bits you need.





How to use this book...learning C
reading another book on C, so you need to refresh your memory.
Hopefully if you do comeback to this repo, you also add things to it, rephrase things etc


What type of challenge would require a user to put into practice nearly all the concepts?
Or should this just be an amazing glossary?


Most people coming to this I imagine are coming from high level languages. I think
they'll be curious about how you read and write files when that's such a highly convenient
thing we do in other scripting languages, that we take for granted...



It's highly encouraged you still find other interpretations, examples and visuals. Sometimes
we need to see or read about a concept in several different ways before it becomes part of our mental model.



Same with malloc...seems like an intially complicated as hell thing. It even sounds scary AF.



I definetely don't want to throw too many things at people, but I liked how Bradfield was pretty self
contained and we had few very powerful videos that got us thinking and appreciate programming more.






































Who's my target audience?
- Students, Professionals, new programmers
- I definetely don't want a stripe like homepage, but I want something solid, flat, majestic and empowering...
- What tone do I want to give through the entire book?

Dont use related...? Or make them jump around 

This is more like a polished toolkit, ..read art of learning notes. Explore and build intuition.



idiomatic C "How I program C"

I simply want to inspire with this book, art of learning/oz style as well.
