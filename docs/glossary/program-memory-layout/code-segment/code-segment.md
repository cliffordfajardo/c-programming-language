# Code (or text) Segment
This area contains the machine code of a compiled program. Usually, the text segment


### Examples
The code segment is sharable so that only a single copy needs to be in memory on our computer for frequently executed programs,
such as text editors, the C compiler, the shells, and so on. 

The code segment of an executable object file is often read-only segment that prevents a program from being accidentally modified.
