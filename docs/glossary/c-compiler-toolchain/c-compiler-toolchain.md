### Why is the compiler toolchain broken into different parts?
- View code in it's intermediary stages
- Some codebases may be very large.

Not sure..need to google why we need this 'intermediary' step. I assume it was do with how assembly
language constructs closely map to the hardware of the computer, whereas the C language doesn't, its a higher
level language with syntatic sugar over the more verbose assembly language.
