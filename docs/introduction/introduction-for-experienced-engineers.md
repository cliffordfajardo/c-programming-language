# What is C?

# A Brief History of C
C is a strongly typed programming language that's been around since the 1970's. C was considered one of the 
first high level languages back in it's day, now its considered a low-level language for several reasons:

- C sits above right above assembly code in the software hierachy of programming languages, so its close to the hardware.

- many programming languages have been creating using C, so they sit 'on top' of C. For example, many of
the reference implementations of the following programming languages were written in C due to C's  wide
availability (across what??):

  - C++ (originally called C with classes), its C with lots of OOP concepts.
    - Javascript was written in C++.
  - PHP, Perl, Python, Lua are written in C


# Notable Features of C
- C style is function oriented as opposed to objected oriented. Function oriented shouldn't be confused with "functional programming" like Haskell where functions are the only construct for loops and most data is immutable.

- When you compile a C program, it's compiled directly to machine code (binary..0101011) which can be run directly on hardware immediately, whereas other languages will
will compile to bytecode,
