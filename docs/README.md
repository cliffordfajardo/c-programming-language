# C Programming Language
> This repo contains small examples of several c programs with explanations.

# Motivation
A few months ago, I was learning C again, but totally felt out place since I hadn't used it in a while; I haven't used C in production nor do I code with it at work; It's likely won't be the last time I use C. 

I created this repo of fully self contained runnable code examples C programs with explaining of what the code does.

C has been around for 30 years, it isn't going anywhere anytime soon.


NOTE: i created this for myself, so the repo isn't as polished as it could be. I'm still learning how to make a repo more user friendly. I'm open to suggestions.
