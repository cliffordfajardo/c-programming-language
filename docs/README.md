# C Programming Language
> This repo contains small examples of several c programs with explanations.

# Motivation
A few months ago, I was learning C again, but totally felt out place since I hadn't used it in a while, nor is it
language which I've used in production code at this time. It likely won't be the last time I use C, thus I thought 
I created fully self contained runnable example programs with explaining of what the code does.
C has been around for 30 years so I'm surmise this documentation could at least last me a but of time; I can always update it anyways.
